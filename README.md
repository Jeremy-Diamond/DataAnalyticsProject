# Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze a large set up data and answer three questions. The data set I used was https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023 and it was a list of the most streamed songs on Spotify 2023. 

The reason I chose to do this project was to practice my data analysis and visualization skills. I wanted to learn how to use different types of graphs and how to use different types of data analysis. I have also not had much experience using python for data analysis and wanted to learn more about it. I particularly wanted to learn how to use the pandas library and how to use it to analyze data along with the charting libraries matplotlib and plotly.

# Data Analysis Results
The three questions I chose to answer were:
    What are the five most streamed songs in 2023?
       Answer: Blinding Lights, Shape of You, Someone You Loved, Dance Monkey, and Sunflower - Spider Man
    Who is the most popular streaming band in 2023? 
        Answer: The Weeknd
    Are the answers to the questions one and two consistent across Spotify and apple playlists? 
        Answer: No, acording to the three graphs I created, the answers are not consistent.

    To see the output of the code there is a pdf named SpotifyDataAnalysis.pdf in the repository.

# Future Work
* Try different types of graphs
* Use a larger dataset with better formatting
* Try different types of data analysis
* Try different types of data visualization
